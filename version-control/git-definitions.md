# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a method used to ensure you have a master copy that will retain it's original unaltered code in the event that it's needed to roll back because the new code doesn't work. It's useful when you have done multiple changes and want to refer back to previous versions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is basically a copy of the current version of the original code you are working on that won't interefere with the original code if making changes. It's used so that you can make changes and test the code prior to updating and merging the code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Committing is a way of closing and saving your project through the git control. It's basically to close up the work you have done and create a message in what you have done so whoever picks up the file later will be able to easily understand his work. A good commit comment explains everything you've done while working on the project clearly. Not vague but, not extensively long.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is basically if you and another coder works on the same line code and makes changes to the same line of code, or area. This can be resolved by fixing the changes made in the editor.
