# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 

> Version control allows developers to keep track and maintain previous versions of software in development. It accomplishes this by recording changes made. This is useful incase an update to the software causes unexpected problems not initially discovered.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

> Branches are comprised of different versions of a core file known as the master branch. These branches (known as feature branches) consist of seperate features that can later be merged with the master branch. This can be useful when two or more teams are working on seperate features for a program incase one team gets done with their feature before the other. This is because the team that finished first can merge their feature to the master branch now and the later team can merge theirs later.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

> Commits create save points for files as well as creates a message describing the save point. A good commit message is one that can clearly describe what the purpose of the save point (what has been changed and/or what still needs to be changed).

* What is a merge conflict?

> Merge conflict arises when a feature branch merges with the master branch but it causes problems. This is usually caused when two or more feature branches creates something that is incompatable with the master branch.
