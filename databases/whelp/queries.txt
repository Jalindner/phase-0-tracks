1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

sqlite> SELECT users.firstname, users.lastname,  businesses.name, reviews.comment FROM users JOIN reviews ON users.id = reviews.user_id JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id;

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
SELECT users.firstname, users.lastname, businesses.name, reviews.comment FROM businesses, users, reviews WHERE businesses.id = 1 AND reviews.business_id = 1 AND users.id = reviews.user_id;
