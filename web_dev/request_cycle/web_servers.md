## Linux Design Philosophy

> The intention of Linux is to offer an open source operating system that assumes compitence from the user, thus allowing them to access and alter everything and anything within the operating system.

## Virtual Private Servers

> Virtual private servers are virtual machines at act as a server[.](https://depressalin.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/cage_vampire.jpg) The advantage of VPS is more apparent in smaller operations. They are easily scalable, less rescource intensive, and are easier to control.

## Running as Root

> Running as the root user instead of a created user poses many security and data risks. Should your machine contract a virus while running as the root, that virus now has unlimited access to the machine's entire system. Should you run an application that has a bug, that bug could potentially erase crucial files if they are running under the root user. Finally, as the root user, you have the freedom to alter anything without the operating system notifying or warning you, which can be dangerous if the wrong command is entered.
